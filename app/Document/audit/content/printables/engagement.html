    <p class="text-center"><strong class="b-b b-grey"> Re-Engagement letter for auditing services</strong> </p>
    <p> Dear Sirs, </p>
    <p><strong class="b-b b-grey">Article 1: The objective and scope of the audit</strong> </p>
    <p> You have informed us we are selected to audit the financial statements of your company, which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as {{audit.sfp_date}}, Statement of Comprehensive Income, Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. We are pleased to confirm our acceptance and our understanding of this audit engagement by means of this letter. Our audit will be conducted with the objective of our expressing an opinion on the financial statements. </p>
    <p><strong class="b-b b-grey">Article 2: The responsibilities of our firm</strong> </p>
    <p> We will conduct our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. </p>
    <p> Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, together with the inherent limitations of internal control, there is an unavoidable risk that some material misstatements may not be detected, even though the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with ISAs. In making our risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. However, we will communicate to you in writing concerning any significant deficiencies in internal control relevant to the audit of the financial statements that we have identified during the audit. </p>
    <p><strong class="b-b b-grey">Article 3: The responsibilities of management and identification of the applicable financial reporting framework </strong> </p>
    <p> Our audit will be conducted on the basis that management acknowledge and understand that they have responsibility:
    <ol class="ol-alpha">
        <li>For the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with its accounting policies; </li>
        <li>For such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and </li>
        <li>To provide us with:
            <ol class="ol-roman">
                <li>Access to all information of which management is aware that is relevant to the preparation of the financial statements such as records, documentation and other matters; </li>
                <li>Additional information that we may request from management for the purpose of the audit; and </li>
                <li>Unrestricted access to persons within the entity from whom we determine it necessary to obtain audit evidence. </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p> As part of our audit process, we will request from management written confirmation concerning representations made to us in connection with the audit. We look forward to full cooperation with your staff and we trust that they will make available to us whatever records; documentation and other information are requested in connection with our audit. </p>
    <p><strong class="b-b b-grey">Article 4:  Audit fee and billings</strong> </p>
    <p> Our fees are based on the time necessarily occupied on audit work at rates which take account of the degree of responsibility and skill involved. Where it is necessary for us to perform work outside the responsibilities to be set out in our engagement letter, we wish to remind you that this may involve additional time being spent on your affairs and would therefore involve higher fees.  However, no work which requires an extra fee will be commenced until written instructions are received from you. </p>
    <p> On the basis of our present information, we estimate that our audit fee for general purpose financial statements would be Birr <strong>{{audit.audit_fee|number:2}}</strong> plus 15% value added tax. </p>
    <p> The audit fee will be payable 0 % advance payment at the start of the field work and the remaining 100 % up on delivery of the final audit report. </p>
    <p> Additionally, out-of-town travel costs, hotel accommodation, per diems and other out-of--pocket expenses necessarily incurred for the purposes of the work required will be for the account of our firm. </p>
    <p><strong class="b-b b-grey">Article 5: Starting and Completion date of the work</strong> </p>
    <p> We will commence the audit work as soon as Financial Statements are prepared and all other relevant documents are made available for us and will finalize the field audit work and issue the draft audit report within <strong>{{audit.audit_completion_time}}</strong> days and issue the final within one day after the management has replied to us on the draft report in writing. </p>
    <p> This letter will be effective for three years unless it is terminated, amended or superseded. </p>
    <p> <br/>
        Yours faithfully <br/>
